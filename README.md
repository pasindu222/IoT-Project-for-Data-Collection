# IoT-Project-for-Data-Collection

Part of the final project of elevator traffic control system. We use this to data collect for our final project.

We have developed a circuit using the ESP32 microcontroller and two IR sensor modules to obtain the rotation count of the elevator motor in the machine room.
By utilizing that count, we can identify the floor where the elevator is located and automaticaly  upload floor to a Google Spreadsheet online, allowing us to check the elevator in which floor from anywhere by connecting to the internet and accessing the spreadsheet.
